_Why Don't A Couple of Horses Saddle A Tube And Go For Thunderstorms?_

One is exausted, ones heart is in constant agony, one feels blocked, one doesn't want to feel the amplified pain in ones heart, one intended to become as Body without Organ, any pain that is unable to pass through the whole body as pain wave, but only stays in one organ is not intense enough. It is not pain-full.

  
“观察井盖，找压扁动物尸体，看地下室角落的狗，在举行婚礼的山坡上眺望监狱，黄色垃圾桶被拖走，看到了，改变一个空间的氛围，和ppy在一起的时候像在平淡的日常生活中开辟了一个环绕着我们的另外的空间，一切都可能在不经意之间产生。”  

连续下雨好多天之后第一个晴天的晚上安静得像死而复生，电视声音，远处人说话的声音，走路的轻微踏踏声。虫鸣像一个不变的参照系，渲染所有其他响动。干下来的空间似乎思绪也能不受阻碍地随意游荡，比起下雨时候单调强硬的雨滴声，那种向重力屈服的沉重的声音，现在这种清透的感觉显得十分轻盈。

每次拉开距离就会感觉掉入了真空，本来下面有一层土壤什么的，虽然很薄，但是感觉不到它薄，不会意识到它的存在，只是安心地在上面生长过日子，当感觉到这层东西被抽走了，只剩下真空，没有底的阴暗，天也要塌了，周围都融化了，崩塌了，掉下去了，总之，这层东西是我从未在意过的直到最近。
  
夜晚的安静暂且告一段落，前几日听了两首有女声的歌，最近就出现在梦里，向往身体的振动，整个身体以及身体周围关联一切的振动，最直接的最物质的振动，人之间想必也可以由这样的振动联系在一起。

和另外的成分相联的经验大大淡化了这种有害成分的记忆，在整个世界里面四处“逃窜”，在物质世界之中逃窜，不是那个人为假想的层级世界，固化的结构阻滞一切生命力量，如今这种成分的触手依然时不时伸过来，防不慎防。看来里尔克的小散文并没有被某些人会到，这些不断伸出触手的人，试图将根茎变成树根，浑然不觉，追蝴蝶的简单让人不可想象。一个人和一只偶然出现的蝴蝶构成一个生成。这个实验虽作游戏，但这个游戏让人享受陶醉的一方面就是留出自由和容许参与者隐形的特殊时空，在其中自由逃窜，屏蔽或切断那些触手，不比切断手机信号容易，手机生成沼泽。

There was this little boy sitting in front of me in a subway. He looks just like him, his eyes and chubby checks. Dan yan pi, he was with his family, his mom and little sister or brother in a stroller, his mom looked nothing like him. He was picking at his scar around one of his elbows, he fell maybe, it was a big scar compared with his tiny volume, I moved my eyes all over him, then fixed on his hands, tiny hand, is he going to loose one of his little pinky one day too, maybe something more than that. He looked so innocent even though he s got this scary look on him just like abysm, where is abysm, I wouldn’t even notice a kid like that if it wasn’t for him, abysm, the one and only, stabbed my heart right to the point, hurt me just right, so I can do nothing but carry on with my life, I was forced to be a fighter because of him, his cruelty and edge left me with no other choice, what an old fashioned mob who made me notice this kid, who resembles him, round face chubby danyanpi fair skin scars frictions brave male inertia heavy dense like bulldogs.

I got paranoid or maybe I didn’t, cause his indifference was for real. His absence, his playing around making use of me from time to time emotionally. I got annoyed and deleted his wechat. Then I went back to check if I can add him back why I don’t know then I found out I can’t without his noticing it there’s literally a notice message for him to notice, then ill be damned all craziness revealed, there she is beyond craziness. I thought he deleted me too, I got mad and so frustrated so I deleted more people on wechat mostly irrelevant people with whom I hadn’t messaged for over a year or forever. Then I can’t stop crying on the airplane I stared at those majestic clouds walls and blue blue sky, how could I be bothered by something like this when I m facing a view like that. Because the sky is blue it makes me cry, no it’s not the blue sky that makes me cry it’s not beauty that made me cry it’s being petty and paranoid being passive toward life and love which made me cry which is way worse than beautiful cries. Mythus I was just crazy cries, it’s craziness that’s crying mourning over something that’s already dead and passed what’s worse a mourn over nothing cause nothing happened, is it a molecular dimension or just nothng, like the thing they been waiting for, nothing happened happening will happen, cry as sadly as you can, nothing happened your sadness was In vain it has got no power in it, it’s empty and weak the thing you have been trying so hard to grab was nothing what is it you try to grab, you gotta regard it as nothing first then try to carry on with your nothing happens life, crying facing majestic clouds and blue sky or eye blinding sunlight let your tear drops run over your mask and shining in the light was something else to be cried over.
The moment I “found” I was betrayed by my interpretation of reality or something else, like I won’t be able to speak to him for the rest of my life, just this thought was unbearable, what’s the point of going anywhere it’s solitude all the same, why sitting on this plane, all these unified into one intense feeling, just feeling cause it’s not that strong, a feeling of all my bones got pulled/sucked out of my body instantly, abruptly, (*what is missing is love, a faith a thing to believe in, who else I could find in this world to be the medium of my love the object of my love, rather. Love is lost when it’s lack of expression.*)the rupture is called insanity. It’s a process of synthesis, simplification the exclusion of water, so I can’t stop crying. Firstly you feel emptied out, blowed, then you get more compact, denser, like muscles, bodybuilding, body without organs though, to overcome yourself by blowing yourself hard by a false recognition of reality by exaggerating everything you care about too much, when will you be able to dismantle yourself? After a hard blow? How about dismantling love? To dismantle love to love, oh well I give up, you do whatever you want, I will leave you there and carry on with my life, you be this little boy for the rest of your life, all I want is you being at least my not so close friend. Knowing that I know you someone In this world like you would calm me down well enough. Cause I have experienced once what’s it like to be without the thread of you, some delicate fibers, maybe I should record all these on that fiber blog, I be your garbage can the internet mine.
